# Minor-Variant-Phasing-Tool
Minor-Variant-Phasing-Tool for Pacbio data

## Input
* Bam file: Bam file should be generated by Pacbio blasr program with CCS reads. _The CCS sequences for alignment: 10 full pass, barcode quality of >= 45, predicted read accuracy >= 0.99._
* Reference file: Fasta format.
* SNPs file: results from LoFreq, with first column records _segment name_, second for _position_, third for _Ref nucleotide_ and the fourth for _Alt nucletide_. Just like below:
CHROM | POS | REF | ALT
Brisbane_PB1_codon_mutant | 4 | G | A
Brisbane_M_codon_mutant_ | 92 | G | C
brisbane_NS_codon_mutant | 100 | A | G

## Output
* Phasing graph
